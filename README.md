Hacking with Swift: 100 Days of Swift - Project 10

## Challenge

1. Add a second UIAlertController that gets shown when the user taps a picture, asking them whether they want to rename the person or delete them.
2. Try using picker.sourceType = .camera when creating your image picker, which will tell it to create a new image by taking a photo. This is only available on devices (not on the simulator) so you might want to check the return value of UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable() before trying to use it!
3. Modify project 1 so that it uses a collection view controller rather than a table view controller. I recommend you keep a copy of your original table view controller code so you can refer back to it later on.
